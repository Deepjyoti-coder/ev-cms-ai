Preparing AI Prompt – 1

☑ AI Prompt:

"I want to make a small live project for our college event.
Please help me create everything step-by-step and also explain what you are doing while building it.

The idea is to build a Simple EV-Charger Monitoring System that looks real and works online."

EV-Charger Monitoring System: Project Introduction

Preparing AI Prompt – 2

☑ AI Prompt:

"Here is what I want the system to do:

There should be one Dashboard Web Page that shows:

How many chargers are currently online / active

How much total power is being used

A live list of who is currently charging, showing:

Vehicle number

Amount paid

Charging start time"

EV-Charger Monitoring System: Dashboard Requirements

Preparing AI Prompt – 3

☑ AI Prompt:

"There should be a second User Entry Web Page, where a user can enter:

Vehicle number

Amount they want to pay for charging

After they click submit, the data should automatically be stored in the online database."

EV-Charger Monitoring System: User Input Page Requirements

Preparing AI Prompt – 4

☑ AI Prompt:

"Whatever users submit should appear instantly on the dashboard without reloading the page.

For total power usage, assume:
Each active charger consumes 0.01 watt per second.

The dashboard should continuously update the total power value in real-time using this formula."

EV-Charger Monitoring System: Real-Time Power Update Logic

Preparing AI Prompt – 5

☑ AI Prompt:

"I do not know what tools or databases to use.
Please select free and easy tools or services that can:

Host web pages

Store live data

Also explain why you selected them.

I want to host the entire project on GitHub, so anyone can open it in a browser and see the live dashboard.
Make sure everything works directly from GitHub Pages without any paid servers."

EV-Charger Monitoring System: Tools & Hosting Requirements

Preparing AI Prompt – 6

☑ AI Prompt:

"Step 1:
Decide which online database we should use and create it.
Make the required tables or collections to store:

Charger information

Charging session entries

Explain in simple language what each table or collection will do."

Database Setup Instructions

Preparing AI Prompt – 7

☑ AI Prompt:

"Step 2:
Create all the website files needed for the dashboard and the user form.
Name the files and explain clearly what each file does.
Include the complete working code for every file."

Website File Creation & Code Requirements

Preparing AI Prompt – 8

☑ AI Prompt:

"Step 3:
Explain how these files communicate with the online database so that:

New submissions appear instantly

Power usage updates automatically based on the 0.01 watt per second formula."

Live Database Communication & Auto-Update Logic

Preparing AI Prompt – 9

☑ AI Prompt:

"Step 4:
Explain how to upload everything to GitHub and make the system public using GitHub Pages (or any similar free method)."

Hosting Instructions

Preparing AI Prompt – 10

☑ AI Prompt:

"Step 5:
Show me how to test the system:

Enter data using the user page

Observe live updates on the dashboard

See the total power value changing in real time"

Testing Instructions

Preparing AI Prompt – 11

☑ AI Prompt:

"Step 6:
Give a short summary explaining how this project is similar to a real EV-Charger Monitoring System used in the industry."
